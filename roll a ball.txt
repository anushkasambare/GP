STEP 10:
Go to asset
>right click on code
>create
>click on C# script
>rename it as ballmotion
>right click on file ballmotion

public Text scoreboard;
public int score=0;
public Text winboard;
void update()
{
float hinput=Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
float vinput=Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
Rigidbody me=GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
Vector3 motion=new Vector3(hinput,0.of,vinput);
me.AddForce(motion*speed);
}
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision who)
{
if(who.gameObject.CompareTag("obst"))
{
who.gameObject.SetActive(false);
score=score+1;
scoreboard.text="Score:" + score.ToString();
if(score==12)
{
winboard.text="YOU WIN!";
speed=0;
}
}
}

Type the code
private Vector3 camandball;
public GameObject anyobj;
void Start()
{
camandball=transform.position-anyobj.transform.position;
}
void Update()
{
transform.position=anyobj.transform.position+camandball;
}
STEP16:
Go to asset...right click on code...create....click on c# project..rename it as obstacle
Rightclick on file obstacle...click on open c# project
TYPE HE CODE
//start is called before the first frame update
void Start()
{
}
//update is called once per frame
void Update()
{
tranform.Rotate(new Vector3(15,30,45)*Time.deltaTime);
}
STEP17:
